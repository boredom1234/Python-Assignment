This system provides a comprehensive solution for parking lot administrators to oversee and control the entire parking process. It incorporates technologies like RFID, automated ticketing systems, and CCTV surveillance to monitor vehicle entry and exit, allocate parking spaces, and handle payment transactions. The system helps optimize parking space utilization, reduces congestion, and enhances security by recording vehicle details and time-stamping entries. Additionally, it offers real-time data analysis and reporting, enabling administrators to track revenue, monitor parking trends, and make informed decisions for improving overall parking facility management. With its user-friendly interface and automated functionalities, the Vehicle Parking Management System aims to provide a seamless and hassle-free parking experience for both the parking lot operators and the users.\"\n",
